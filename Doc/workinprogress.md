# Vote on topics, work in progress!

> **Note** The voting system is not in place yet. At the moment this is a list of things I am looking at for documentation. [I'll blog](http://blog.galasoft.ch) and [tweet](http://twitter.com/lbugnion) as soon as the voting system is in place.

I want this area to be as useful to you as possible. I have a lot of ideas of stuff I want to write on and write sample for. But of course it makes sense to select topics that are most useful to the most of you. In this area you will see the ideas I have, which will serve for me as a notebook of sorts, and you will be able to leave comments. I will periodically check here to see what I should work on next.

You can also feel free to suggest topics here. While I am not able to work on everything myself, we have a whole team of Cloud Developer Advocates who are eager to help. Leave a comment below!

Here are the topics I am thinking about at the moment:
