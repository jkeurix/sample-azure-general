# Creating and testing a Timer triggered function

Here is how you can add and test a Timer triggered function. These functions will be triggered on a schedule. You will use an expression (known as a CRON expression) to specify the timing at which the function should be executed. Follow these steps:

1. Right click on the project in the Solution Explorer and select Add, New Item from the context menu.
2. In the Add New Item dialog, select Azure Function. Give it a name and press Add.

3. In the New Azure Function dialog, select Timer trigger.

> Note: You can already modify the CRON function during this step, or you can wait until later. We will discuss the CRON function in more details further down.

4. Press OK to create the function.

The following code is generated by Visual Studio:

```CS
    public static class Timer
    {
        [FunctionName("Timer")]
        public static void Run(
            [TimerTrigger("0 */5 * * * *")]
            TimerInfo myTimer, 
            TraceWriter log)
        {
            log.Info($"C# Timer trigger function executed at: {DateTime.Now}");
        }
    }

```

In this code, we notice that the function trigger is parametered by the [TimerTrigger attribute](TODO). Its parameter is a CRON expression.

# Running and testing the Timer triggered function locally

Once the Function is created, you can easily test it. In Visual Studio, place a breakpoint on the first line of the function you want to debug. Then press F5 to build and run your application in debug mode.

The breakpoint will be hit according to the timer, though the very fist time depends on a number of factor. To make it easier, you can modify the CRON expression to make the interval much shorter, for example to force the timer to trigger every 5 seconds with the following CRON expression.

> **Do not forget to restore the original CRON expression before you publish to Azure!!**

```
*/5 * * * * *
```

After the breakpoint is hit, you can step through your code just as you would in any .NET application. Once you are satisfied with the results, restore the original CRON expression according to your specifications, and you can publish the function to Azure.
