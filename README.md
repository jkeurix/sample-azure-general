# Welcome to my Azure Samples

This project contains general information about Microsoft Azure as well as a maintained list of relevant samples and documentation. In the next few months/year, I hope to build a significant list of samples and documentation related to Microsoft Azure, Xamarin, Windows, the Model-View-ViewModel pattern and more.

Your feedback is important to us! [Please don't hesitate to contact me on Twitter!!](http://twitter.com/LBugnion).
